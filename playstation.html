			outselling all other consoles - including Sony's own PlayStation 2. A total of 28.15 million PS one units had been sold by the time it was discontinued in March 2006. 
			A version of the PS one included a 5-inch (130 mm) LCD screen, referred to as the "Combo pack". 
			The PlayStation Controller is the first gamepad released by Sony Computer Entertainment for its PlayStation video game console. 
			The original version (model SCPH-1010) was released alongside the PlayStation on December 3, 1994.
