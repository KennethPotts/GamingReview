<!-- Found text on wikipedia and a news source-->
         <p id="string">
			A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a 
			user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as 
			a TV screen or computer monitor. The word video in video game traditionally 
			referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any 
			type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. 
			Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation 
			is controversial.
         </p>
		
		<h2>The Benefits of Video Games</h2>
		
         <p>
			Video games are often seen as a time waster with no beneficial qualities,
			but research that has been conducted from various sources says otherwise.
			Video games stimulate that brain and can improve coordination and problem solving 
			skills. Video games also enhances the memory through visuala nd audio ques that need
			to be memorized to beat the game. Action video games imporove concentration and attention
			, this is brought about by the players need to achieve objectives and make split second 
			decisions.

		 <h2>Pong worlds first video game success</h2>
<!--External hyperlink on the word pong-->		 
         <p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank"> Pong</a> quickly became a success and was the first commercially successful video game, which helped 
			to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. 
			Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied Pong's gameplay, 
			and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce 
			more innovative games. The company released several sequels that built upon the original's 
			gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version 
			of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores. It was also a commercial success and led to numerous copies. 
			The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. 
			Pong is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. due to its cultural impact. 
			Pong has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games, 
			and has been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions.
         </p>
		 
		 <h2>PacMan makes Big Bucks</h2>
		 
         <p>
			When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shootersâ€”in particular, 
			Space Invaders and Asteroids. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. 
			Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre.[12] Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history 
			and is among the most famous arcade games of all time.[13] It is also one of the highest-grossing video games 
			of all time,[14] having generated more than <b>$2.5 billion</b> in quarters by the 1990s.
