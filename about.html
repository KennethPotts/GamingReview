		<h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to my webpage, my name is Kenneth Dennis potts I am a student of Computer Informations systems at Olympic college.
			I have been obsessed with video games even from a young age, they were magical and engaging to me. My very first video game 
			came on a floppy disk and was named archer my father at the time got his brand new personal computer the first one he has ever owned.
			It was this game and computer that shaped me as a person since video games has become my favorite hobby and I have played a ton of them.
			I have owned the Ps2, Ps3, Ps4, Gameboy, DS, Wii, Gamecube, N64, and a PC with steam granting me a wide variety of games.
			Some of my favorite games are the metroid series, Mario series, Sly Cooper series, Rampage, Bomberman 64 and Red dead Redemption to name a few.
			This website will showcase all the games I have played, going through the history of the game, my opinion on the game and their impact.
