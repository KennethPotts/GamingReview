				<h1><u>Reviews</u></h1>	
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Sly Cooper 3</strong> Is one of my childhood favorite games. It was awesome I loved the soundtrack and sfx, the visuals were  bright and colorful but the graphics have aged but for their time they were amazing. 
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Star Wars BattleFront</strong> I have scored a ton of hours into this game, the campaign, multiplayer were reallly fun. The graphics were good for the timeperiod and sound was also good me and my brother would wake up extra early and play this game on the weekends till we had to sleep so this game holds a special place in my heart.
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Star Wars BattleFront 2</strong> If I liked the first game the second I loved. This was a direct step up from the first one the campaign was better there were more gamemodes and the graphics were better. The sound effects were better but were prone to glitching on some maps there would be no audio. I have spent countless hours since I played this game with my brother for literal years since we didnt have the money to afford other games.
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the sith</strong> This game was new and refreshing, and in my opinion this is the best starwars game if you want to experience jedi lightsaber combat. The offline multiplayer had me and my brother entertained for countless hours the storymode was challenging and follower the original revenge of the sith movie very closely. 	
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Lego Star Wars the video game</strong>	Lego star wars was a super fun game to play even as adult. This game made collecting items fun, the combat was not that great but it had fun puzzles and encouraged exploration to achieve the 100% achievement rate.
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Lego Star Wars 2 the original trilology</strong> Lego star wars 2 was the sequal to the first one but dealt with the original trilogy. It was super fun and a more polished game they had a character creation, and took collectiing items to the next level with entire models being able to be built ingame via collecting.	
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Spiderman</strong> Spiderman is one of my favorite hero's of all time. This game made me feel like spiderman you could explore enviroments in very unique ways since you had spidermans abilities. The combat was fun but it had little replayabilty since you could only play storymode and once you beat it that was it.
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Nascar Thunder 2003</strong> This is a game I owned somehow. It was atleast a Little bit of fun since me and my brother would purposely race the other way to crash into other cars to see if we could prevent them from winning. Other then that the controls were not that great and it was a car game, the sound was good since they used very popular songs at the time.	
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>NCAA Final Four 2002</strong> A basketball game it was sorta fun but to me personally there is very little skill in this game and more based on luck. The ai was clunky and the controls were hard, the most I can say about this game is the soundtrack was good since they used popular songs.	
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>FIFA Soccer 2005</strong> I actually had fun with this game since the playing field was very huge you could actually coordinate your player to work together. It was fun but the controls and soundtrack was boring I dont even remember anything good about the two.		
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Shark Tale</strong>	A really fun game the atmosphere for some level were really awesome. They had differen minigames that you could play and they were all really hard but fun. They had racing and dancing in this game and to this very day I find it almost impossible to score a perfect on either of those minigames.	
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Spiderman Friend or For</strong> Spiderman friend or foe was fun since you could play as some of the villians from the spiderman series. The downside was the combat was really boring each character had different moves but it hardly changed how you played the game. The enemy designs were for the most part all the same except for they had different costumes. 		
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Naruto Ultimate Ninja 3</strong> An extremly fun game we played this game a ton. The character models were pretty poor but the cinematics and jutsu's looked awesome the combat was also really fun. The storymode was original and fun but the only gripe I have is the gameplay had a really luck based mechanic that could break the game at points.		
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Naruto Ultimate Ninja 4</strong> A step up from its predecessor, the character models were better the roster was bigger the story better. The gameplay wasnt as good the comobo's were more limited and they still didnt fix the broken mechanic from its predecessor. The visuals looked better and the music was great. 		
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</strong> A great game the roster was big and the character were all unique. The downside to this game is the graphics could use work and the sound design I felt was kind of lacking. The game was pretty fun and replayable since there were so many characters but the gameplay could be stale at points.		
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="Column">
						<strong>Midnight Club</strong> A really fun racing game, it was silly but really challenging. You could get a hovercar and other wacky design it was filled with interesting area's that you wouldnt think you could go to. A pretty awesome soundtrack and visuals but it was a car game at the end of the day so gameplay could get stale.
